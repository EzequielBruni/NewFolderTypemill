# NewFolder

A private design system that you're free to use, if you like it. It was designed for my own personal projects. It's based on SASS, mostly, and it's meant to be easily dropped in, and integrated with any CMS you need.

You can see it live on [my personal website](https://ezequiel.works), and see all the styles at work in [the demo respository](https://github.com/EzequielBruni/NewFolder-Demo).

## Features

* A pseudo-flat aesthetic
* CSS variables for changing your color scheme quickly
    * **New!** NewFolder now includes a dark mode thanks to `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {}`.
* Layout-agnostic. The navigation patterns mostly use Flexbox, but you can use CSS Grid for the overall page layout. God knows I will. The rest is up to you.
* Readable typographical styles with type scaling
* Various in-content image styles
* Form styles (still somewhat in-progress)
* Alert/admonition boxes for information, warnings, and success alerts
* Navigation patterns for in-content accordions and breadcrumbs.

## Things I'm still working on:

* A full conversion to pure CSS. This will take some time, as CSS has some catching up to do, compared to SASS.
* Integration with CMSs like [Typemill](https://typemill.net), and [Bludit](https://www.bludit.com). Again, this is for my own personal benefit, mostly.
